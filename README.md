Infix_To_Postfix
================

Implementations of infix to postfix converters and evaluation of the expression using integer stacks via linked lists.

First, you will be prompted to enter the infix expression. Do so.
Use +,-,*,/ and parenthesis, as needed.
Then, the postfix expression and the value of the expression will be diplayed.
Two stacks are maintained, one for integers and one for operators.

To convert and evaluate a new expression, press 'y'. To quit, press any other key.
P.S. : To multiply a negative number, please enter infix as 1*(-2), not 1*-2. Continuous operators are not allowed.
